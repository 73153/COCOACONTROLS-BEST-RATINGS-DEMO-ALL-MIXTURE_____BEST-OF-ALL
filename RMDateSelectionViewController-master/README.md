##Installation
###CocoaPods
```ruby
platform :ios, '7.0'
pod "RMDateSelectionViewController", "~> 1.4.3"
```

###Manual
1. Check out the project
2. Add all files in `RMDateSelectionViewController` folder to Xcode

##Usage
###Basic
1. Import `RMDateSelectionViewController.h` in your view controller
	
	```objc
	#import "RMDateSelectionViewController.h"
	```
2. Implement the `RMDateSelectionViewControllerDelegate` protocol
	
	```objc
	@interface YourViewController () <RMDateSelectionViewControllerDelegate>
	@end
	```
	
	```objc
	#pragma mark - RMDateSelectionViewController Delegates
	- (void)dateSelectionViewController:(RMDateSelectionViewController *)vc didSelectDate:(NSDate *)aDate {
		//Do something
	}

	- (void)dateSelectionViewControllerDidCancel:(RMDateSelectionViewController *)vc {
		//Do something else
	}
	```
	
3. Open date selection view controller
	
	```objc
	- (IBAction)openDateSelectionController:(id)sender {
    	RMDateSelectionViewController *dateSelectionVC = [RMDateSelectionViewController dateSelectionController];
    	dateSelectionVC.delegate = self;
    	
   		[dateSelectionVC show];
	}
	```

###Advanced
Every RMDateSelectionViewController has a property datePicker. It is available after `show` has been called. With this property you have total control over the UIDatePicker that is shown in the screen.

Additionally, there is a method called `showFromViewController:`. With this method you can control where the your date picker is shown. For example on an iPad this method can be used to show the date picker in a popover.

## Documentation
There is an additional documentation available provided by the CocoaPods team. Take a look at [cocoadocs.org](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/RMDateSelectionViewController/).

## Requirements
Works with:

* Xcode 6
* iOS 8 SDK
* ARC (You can turn it on and off on a per file basis)

iOS 8 SDK is only needed for compiling (as it uses the blur features provided by iOS 8 SDK). At runtime the control only needs iOS 7 or later.

If you absolutely need to use iOS 7 SDK you can take a look at the iOS 7 branch called [1.3.x](https://github.com/CooperRS/RMDateSelectionViewController/tree/1.3.x)
