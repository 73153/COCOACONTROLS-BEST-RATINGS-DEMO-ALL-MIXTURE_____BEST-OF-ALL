# Introduction

ExpandableTabBar is an iOS custom tab bar control. Its behavior emulates
the system tab bar with the addition of supporting multiple rows.

## Usage

Build and run the application to get a feel for the control. Then
copy the files to your own project.

Since Apple does not make the images and text of system tab bar
items available, they cannot be used.

## Current State

Some animation features are unsupported.
